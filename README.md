# YetAnotherPasteService - YAPS
At KTH there is a course (DM2517) which tackles premier publishing technologies. Namely, XML.
At the time of writing hosted at: [https://yaps-223816.appspot.com/]

Would it be possible to gain access to my Google Instance using this app? Very likely... =P

## What is YAPS?
YAPS is a paste service powered by MySQL where the data is delivered in the form of XSL-Transformed XML.

## Why?
I'm not sure... For a small case such as this it is quite wasteful.

But an intermediate format might be useful in some cases. Like with compilers it could be used as a funnel to connect multiple in:s and out:s.

ps: it was actually kinda fun to make this. The code was hastily written and is lacking comments... but definitely good enough for some quick University Points (HP).
